        <Paragraph>
              For the past 4 years, I have worked in a Aged Care facility helping residents with varying physical and mental abilities make the most of the years they have left. However, I always felt that I could do more, just not within the confines of the facility.

        <Paragraph>
          As a young guy, I always said I wanted to get into game development, but the more I looked into the industry, the more I realised it wasn't for me. I was helping a Registered Nurse dress a resident who had a large wound known as a pressure sore, it was stage 4 (really really bad). The reason I am telling you this is because of my career change. I had an idea that day for an app that would not only help prevent wounds from dying, but would also allow nurses and doctors to treat patients faster.

          Now I understand that not everyone can make the next Uber, but that day I knew I could make a difference as a developer.
